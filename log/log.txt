Session 1 - This session I focused on getting the login/regsiter page to work and adding a payment system. I first sorted out making the new project using django and setting up all the static files and modifying URLs and setting up the systems for the file. Then I imported all the other templates, statics and template tags from the prototype. After that I started working on the login/register system. As mentioned before the final version will not have the previous index page which provides a bridge to all the hubs in the prototype, but a login/register page that directly transfers the user to the designated hub based on their login.The plan for the next session is to add the scanning functions and the qr code and add the other pages and then make sure the data fetched/altered/written is for the right account.

Session 2 - In this session I got the qr code working and unique for the different users that log in, after that I have made sure data fetched and returned were from the right accounts, throughout this I encountered multiple issues as in the system for this procedure, I first tried having unique urls to each student and showing a specific page using that URL, but soon after development I recognised a major security flaw where anyone could access other account by just modifying the URL , to fix this I tried multiple different procedures but all of them resulted in issues and complications, I ended up switching to a different technique where the login page passes on a request header with the information I needed like the student id. The benefits of this is the URL would be the same for any account but the data inside is different, eliminating the security concerns. After this I worked on the login/registration pages making sure users can register/login properly instead of as before where I just manually added the data. The plan for the next session is to ensure the login/register works perfectly and start adding some of the other pages.      

Session 3 - By now I have fixed all the issues such as the login/regsiter and started adding all the other pages, the pages left now are the stats,reserve and sDetails. MenuS is pending to have the add item feature added. Throughout this session my main aim was to get through the base framework for the pages, I got through all the pages and made sure the data displayed would be right for the account. I added all the other pages with the right data suited to the account logged in. The plan for the next session would be to finally finish the other pages and make sure the hubs shows all the available pages.

ValueError at /reserve/
Field 'student_id' expected a number but got ''.

tags cant write to db

for student details in teachers, it should display data instead of giving you just the option to edit stuff

issue with register process : 
An invalid form control with name='p1name' is not focusable., suspicion is due to hidden divs. 

Session 4 - By now I have gone through and completed all the pages, fixed all the bugs and am ready for the project to be delivered, last things left to do now is to create the requirements.txt and README.md files.
