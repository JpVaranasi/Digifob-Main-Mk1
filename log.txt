Session 1 - This session I focused on getting the login/regsiter page to work and adding a payment system. I first sorted out making the new project using django and setting up all the static files and modifying URLs and setting up the systems for the file. Then I imported all the other templates, statics and template tags from the prototype. After that I started working on the login/register system. As mentioned before the final version will not have the previous index page which provides a bridge to all the hubs in the prototype, but a login/register page that directly transfers the user to the designated hub based on their login.The plan for the next session is to add the scanning functions and the qr code and add the other pages and then make sure the data fetched/altered/written is for the right account.
